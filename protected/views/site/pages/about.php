<h1>About</h1>

<p>EPP is the Extensible Provisioning Protocol. EPP (defined in RFC 5730 and subsequent documents) is an application layer client-server protocol for the provisioning and management of objects stored in a shared central repository.</p> 
<p>Specified in XML, the protocol defines generic object management operations and an extensible framework that maps protocol operations to objects. As of writing, its only well-developed application is the provisioning of Internet domain names, hosts, and related contact details.
